# PointCorrelator
A tool to help making point correlations between real coordinates and image coordinates(pixels).

###### TODO ######

1. Make possible to resize Points Surface scaling down what's drawn in it and without losing the original point coordinate.

2. Write the point correlation system (click on some point in the generated point image and click on some point(pixel) in the loaded image and draw a line between the two).

3. Generate a text file from 2.
