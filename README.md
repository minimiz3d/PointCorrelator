# PointCorrelator
A tool to help making point correlations between real coordinates and image coordinates(pixels).

###### TODO ######

1. Make possible to resize Points Surface scaling down what's drawn in it and without losing the original point coordinate. **IN PROGRESS**

2. Write the point correlation system (click on some point in the generated point image and click on some point(pixel) in the loaded image and draw a line between the two). **DONE**

3. Generate a text file from 2. **DONE**

4. Remove points already highlighted/connected. **IN PROGRESS**

5. Make more user-friendly.

6. Change how drawing lines work. Instead of drawing lines one time, draw inside the draw() loop from connected_points list.

**NOT CURRENTLY WORKING**
